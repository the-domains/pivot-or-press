<h1>Up and Running with the Grid</h1><p>First entry post into the Pivot or Press Grid platform. The aim here is to explore the Grid, which is an online creation and curation tool that aims to streamline the process of publishing content. It achieves this by using a blend of AI, beautiful design and custom parameters.</p><p>As a freelance developer and designer this is an interesting concept and I didn't hesitate signing up for the beta back in early 2015. The promise of AI handling all the layout decisions, hacks and scripting sounds like a dream come true. </p><p>My love of web design has deteriorated over the years, once a bright eyed novice full of passion for creating stylish websites, but now thanks to the never ending grind of browser compatibility, scripting hacks, plugin updates and bug fixing has resulted in turning my back on web development, particularly for clients.</p><p>Now, my focus has switched from developing and designing sites, to building my own online brands and ventures using existing solid platforms such as WordPress. This allows me to focus more on developing strategies to monetise value from the curation of good engaging content and not worrying about the scripting, layout and database calls happening in the background.</p><p>Although WordPress is a great platform, it still involves a good level of understanding and effort to really ensure a site stays secure, functional and optimised for SEO and user experience. This is time well spent for a project that has potential to generate a good income stream, but for a basic journal blog or a small 5 page brochure site , I find the setup and maintenance cycle all a bit laborious and time consuming, which can often inhibit the ability to just quickly create and share a piece of content.</p><p>The Grid looks in principle to offer a solution to this, so I'm excited to see how it all works. To help explore the Grids features I intend to use my first site as my online journal titled Pivot or Press, a name I have taken from a phrase from the highly recommended book Lean Startup, by Eric Ries.</p><p>The concept of pivot or press is based around the lean startup methodology of validated learning. The idea is that the process of working towards a goal can be shortened and be more effective when introducing small A/B tests from which to measure and learn as you progress. This allows you make informed decisions to either press on or pivot to a new path based on your evaluations. This approach has helped me tremendously in both my business ventures and my personal decision making.</p><p>As part of this approach it is important to record, document and muse over your theories, experiments and findings. This allows you to go back and re-visit decision and notes. Maintaining this discipline of documenting can be a struggle, so it can be useful to commit to publishing a scheduled public blog. The awareness that your writing is open to public consumption can encourage a heightened level of consideration and reflection, allowing you to produce a much more valuable entry for your own use than if you were to scribble a few personal notes in a hidden private area. Plus the idea that your own findings can be useful to others is a rewarding experience that can also open up additional benefits such as potential collaborative connections.</p><p>The idea of a public blog is anything new, but the idea was recently re-introcuded to me by Seth Goddin, in his appearance on <a href="http://fourhourworkweek.com/2016/02/10/seth-godin/">Tim Ferriss's podcast</a>. Seth, a hugely successful entrepreneur commits himself to a blog post every day, a therapeutic practice he finds effective and believes everyone should do. Tim Ferriss, also introduced me to the concept of the 5 Minute Journal, which is another daily practice that can help re-calibrate your focus and effectiveness. </p><p>A combination of these these two recommendations, aligned with the need to test out the Grid has led me to create this Pivot or Press site, with the main objectives:</p><ul><li>To learn how to use the Grid interface.</li><li>To start a public online blog to record my experiments and findings.</li></ul><p>To begin with, I will aim to feedback my views on the Grid as I progress through the guides and tutorials. I also intend to keep my scheduled posts flexible and varied, so expect to see content related to my ventures in digital marketing, passive income, self development, fitness and tech.</p><p>Let the journey begin ...</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="25"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="26"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="27"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="28"><span data-reactid="29"><!-- react-empty: 30 --><h2 data-reactid="31"><a data-reactid="32">Up and Running with the Grid</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="33"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="34"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="35"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="36"></div></section></div></div>
